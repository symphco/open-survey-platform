  any donation amount is greatly appreciated.

  Applied patch from solquimpo in this issue: https://drupal.org/node/2097223, to correct an in-correctly
  set pre-render value which sometimes results in a warning being thrown from the Webform module.
  
  Added support for webform markup fields as per issue: https://drupal.org/node/1968464
  

2013-07-31
 Fixed strange CSS issue which caused textareas to resize in certain themes on save.
 Thanks to spamsammy, here: https://drupal.org/node/1241750#comment-7147666
 
 Added extra handling for date field (does not add resizable handlers if its in a date field)
 
 Added instructions to click the Save position data button twice to make sure the form's height
 is calculated correctly.
  
 
2013-02-06
 Fixed issue where added form_id's were not being trimmed, and \r was added
 to the end of the settings line for Windows users.


2013-01-29
 Fixed issue #1442932.
 
 Added experimental new feature - Snap to grid when resizing.  This should
 help line up text fields when needed to resize them.

 Added checks to keep notices from showing up.

5-21-2012
 Fix for this bug: http://drupal.org/node/1473166.  The issue is that
 the Ajax file upload field is no longer draggable.  I fixed it by
 re-arranging how and when the draggable wrappers are added to elements,
 placing them in a #pre_render function now.

2-26-2012
 Added ability to control the "grid width" used with Arrange Fields.
 It is on the settings page.  Default is 10px.  If set to 1px, this
 allows users to move fields with a complete freedom of movement.
 Based on issue: http://drupal.org/node/1456534

2-22-2012
 Changed how the Arrange Fields style tag is set, as well as how
 the form is targetted in CSS to be more specific.
 based on advice from this issue: http://drupal.org/node/1450450

2-19-2012
 Made changes to keep a STRICT warning from appearing, as per this issue:
 http://drupal.org/node/1170352
 

1-28-2012
 Made changes to fix a persistant issue for some users, where textfields
 sometimes have a height of only 1px.  To this end, this module no
 longer attempts to set the height of textfields, only textareas.
 The orignal issue is: http://drupal.org/node/1241750


12-19-2011
 Added very small CSS tweak, to correct a problem with the webform datepicker component, 
 which caused it to stack its elements in a weird way. Isse: [#1372978]

9-25-2011
 Thanks to user drizzi (http://drupal.org/user/226909) for letting me debug on his server, I discovered the
 solution to an anoying bug affecting several Webforms users.  When you set
 the label to be "inline" in webforms, a strange interaction with CSS and jQuery UI
 caused textfields to resize strangely.  From now on, use Arrange Fields to set the
 label as inline or not.
 
 Also, fixed an issue where sometimes form elements wind up "stacked" on top of each other
 when arranging fields for the first time.
 
 Also fixed a bug where setting radio buttons/checkboxes to inline, then back to block
 caused a problem.

9-24-2011
 Found a bug which was causing certain webform components to not be
 configurable (they didn't get the configure link on the hover handle),
 and they were not being recognized as webform components.

9-22-2011
 Added the ability to specify module include files along with form_id's, 
 on the Arrange Fields settings page.

6-30-2011
 Added support for the Mollom module, when using Webforms (it was not
 arrangable until now)

5-26-2011
 Added a new "Enable form_id discovery mode" checkbox to the settings
 page to make it easier to find out form id's on the page.  If checked,
 administrators will see a printout at the top of every page with a list
 of what forms are on that page. You can then enter those form_id's into
 the settings page to arrange them.

4-17-2011
 Somehow the png graphic for the grid got corrupted, so
 I am replacing it.

3-19-2011
 Made minor change to prevent a notice from showing up when
 arranging a content type (the notice was coming from core's
 node.pages.inc, line 303).

3-16-2011
 Made a minor change when looking at elements in the form array
 to prevent PHP notice messages from appearing.

1-26-2011
 Made a slight change to init a variable before using it. This
 was causing a PHP Notice to appear in certain situations.

01-14-2011
  Tweaking some display issues, and doing my best to get rid
  of PHP notices being generated from this module.  Also, corrected
  some instruction text to be correct for D7, instead of D6.

01-13-2011
  Putting out the first (alpha) release for Drupal 7

01-07-2011
  Working from the 6x-1.4 version of Arrange Fields to try and create
  a port for D7.
